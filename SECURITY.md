### 2. Report Privately

Contact us through one of the following methods:

- **Email**: security@django-user-starter.org
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Click the "Security" tab on the project page, then select "Report a vulnerability"

### 3. Provide Detailed Information

Please include in your report:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

### 4. Response Timeline

We commit to:

- **24 hours**: Acknowledge receipt of report
- **72 hours**: Provide initial analysis
- **7 days**: Provide detailed response plan
- **30 days**: Release security patch (if needed)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Stay Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Validate Input**: Be careful with user-provided project names and configurations
3. **Permission Control**: Run tools with minimal privileges
4. **Environment Isolation**: Test generated projects in isolated environments

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Path Checking**: Prevent path traversal attacks
3. **Template Security**: Prevent template injection
4. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies
5. **Static Analysis**: Use tools like bandit for code scanning

## Known Security Considerations

### File System Operations

This tool creates files and directories on the filesystem, with potential risks:

1. **Path Traversal**: Malicious project names could cause files to be written to unexpected locations
2. **File Overwriting**: Existing files might be overwritten
3. **Permission Issues**: Generated files might have inappropriate permissions

**Mitigation**:
- Project name validation and sanitization
- Target directory checking
- Existing file protection
- Appropriate file permission setting

### Template Processing

Tool uses string replacement to generate code, with risks:

1. **Code Injection**: Malicious template content could lead to code injection
2. **Configuration Leakage**: Sensitive configurations might be accidentally included

**Mitigation**:
- Use secure string replacement
- Avoid executing generated code
- Configuration data validation and sanitization

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure principles:

1. **Private Report**: Security researchers report vulnerabilities privately
2. **Develop Fix**: We develop and test fixes
3. **Release Patch**: Release new version with fixes
4. **Public Disclosure**: Disclose vulnerability details after appropriate time following fix release

### Recognition

We appreciate responsible security research and will:

- Credit reporters in fix release notes (unless anonymity requested)
- Maintain list of security researchers
- Consider establishing bug bounty program

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Security updates will be published through:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**
2. **GitHub Releases** (marked as security updates)
3. **PyPI** (new version releases)
4. **Project Documentation** (security announcements page)

### Update Priority

- **Critical**: Immediate fix, emergency release
- **High**: Fix within 7 days
- **Medium**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low**: Fix in next regular release

## Security Tools

We use the following tools to ensure code security:

- **bandit**: Python security static analysis
- **safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: GitHub code security analysis
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Contact Information
